# BenchmarkOne

BenchmarkOne is a C++ application designed for performance testing and benchmarking various computational tasks. It utilizes the GTK library for graphical user interface elements and allows users to execute and compare different mathematical and algorithmic operations efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Benchmarking of matrix multiplication.
- Prime number calculations using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- Floating-point precision tests using Pi calculations.
- Interactive GTK-based user interface.
- Real-time results display and progress tracking.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **GTK** for GUI
- **CMake** for build automation
- **Git** for version control
